# Rdz

## Installation

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) project. Ruby 2.4.0 or later is required. If things don't work, see Jekyllâ€™s [installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

```
bundle install
```

## Run local web server

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The development website will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

## Editing content

* Pages that are mostly text or static content are in the root directory (ex. `about.html`, `404.html`)
* Projects are in `_projects`. Content from there is automatically pulled into the home page so you don't have to manage the home page separately. Eventually there'll be a way to change the order they appear in, or mark them as archived so they don't show up on the home page.
* The `_site` folder is automatically generated by Jekyll and should never be modified directly.
