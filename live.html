<p>In Search of Aztlan… is an intervention based work that follows Rodríguez as he explores the territory around his childhood home, contemplating his roots, and in doing so cracking a window into the US/MX border.  By merging dashcam videos, along with audio recordings of radio signals the work explores how borders, both physical and psychological, shape our individual and collective identities.</p>
